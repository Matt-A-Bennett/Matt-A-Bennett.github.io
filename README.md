## About this site
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>This is a place where I keep a public record of the projects I do in my
spare time. The projects are focused on coding in Python 3 and Bash. The
reason for doing a given project falls into two categories: Either I'm trying
to learn more about some area of coding, or I am sharing something that I made
and find useful to have on my pc.</p>
