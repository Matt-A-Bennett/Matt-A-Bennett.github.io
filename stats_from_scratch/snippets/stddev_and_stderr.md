<p>While the variance of, and covariance between, a set of variables is useful,
they are squared values and as such are not on the same scale as the measured
data. Therefore a useful measure when reasoning about the data is the square
root of the variance. This is called the standard deviation:</p>

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} 
$$

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>If we divide the standard deviation by the square root of the number of
observations, we have the standard error of the mean. This indicates the
uncertainty around the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean (since
the sample mean will not match the population mean exactly). The $\sqrt{n}$
term is like a 'penalty' incurred for making the 'leap' of inference to the
population and this penalty decreases as your sample size increases:</p>
