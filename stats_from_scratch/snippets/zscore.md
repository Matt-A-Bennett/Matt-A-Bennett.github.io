<p>Z-scores are a way of transforming a set of observations such that each
represents the number of standard deviations above or below the mean. This is
useful since it allows you to compare sets of observations measured on
different scales - when fitting models, using standardised scores can aid the
interpretation of how much different variables are contributing to the
model.</p>
