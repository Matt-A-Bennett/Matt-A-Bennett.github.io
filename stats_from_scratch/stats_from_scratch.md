# Building a statistics sub-package for my Numpy-from-scratch library

The full code I've written so far can be found [here](./full_code.md).

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>Now that I've learned the basics of linear algebra and implemented a few of
the methods in my <a href="https://matt-a-bennett.github.io/numpy_from_scratch/numpy_from_scratch.html">linalg</a>
package, I'm going back over my understanding of statistics and model building
to see it from a linear algebra perspective. Therefore I'm going to add a
sub-package called 'stats' to the 'linalg' package, in order to learn about how
packages work in Python 3 and to help cement my understanding as I go.
Everything I do here will be implemented using the existing methods in the
'linalg' package. Here is what I've done so far:</p>
</div>

## Fundamental building blocks
- [Sum and mean](./sum_and_mean.md)
- [Zero-center](./zero_center.md)
- [Variance, covariance, standard deviation and standard error](./var_covar_stddev_stderr.md)
- Zero-score (Coming soon)

## Statistical tests
- Pearson's Correlation (Coming soon)
- t-tests (Coming soon)
