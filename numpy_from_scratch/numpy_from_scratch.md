# Building a Python 3 Numpy-like module from scratch

The full code I've written so far can be found [here](./full_code.md).

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>I want to improve my knowledge of classes, objects, functions and methods in
Python 3 and to gain a better understanding of the 'standard practices'
associated with writing them. So I've decided to try and build a Python library
that allows me to do linear algebra operations - something like the popular
Numpy module, but of course much smaller in scope. As a bonus, it will allow me
to consolidate my recent studies of linear algebra. I will attempt to implement
all the linear algebra operations, methods and algorithms covered in Gilbert
Strang's Introduction to linear algebra. As much as possible, I will use
Python's standard library.</p>

## Classes, methods and functions to implement

<p>Below is a list of the topics I've covered in my studies so far, and which I
will attempt to realise in my library.</p>
