# Building a Python 3 Numpy-like module from scratch
<div style="text-align: justify">
I want to improve my knowledge of classes, objects, functions and methods in
Python 3 and to gain a better understanding of the 'standard practices'
associated with writing them. So I've decided to try and build a Python library
that allows me to do linear algebra operations - something like the popular
Numpy module, but of course much smaller in scope. As a bonus, it will allow me
to consolidate my recent studies of linear algebra. I will attempt to implement
all the linear algebra operations, methods and algorithms covered in Gilbert
Strang's Introduction to linear algebra. As much as possible, I will use
Python's standard library.

## Methods to implement
<div style="text-align: justify">
Below is a list of the topics I've covered in my studies so far, and which I
will attempt to realise in my library.
</div>

### Fundamental Methods
- Transpose
- [Addition/Subtraction](addition_subtraction.md)
- u' * u = dot product
- Scalar Multiplication
- Matrix Multiplication 

### Secondary Methods 
- EA = U
- A = LU
- A = QR
- Rank
- Pivot Columns
- Inverse
- Four fundamental subspaces
- Bases for fundamental subspaces
- Determinant
- Projection
- Orthogonalisation
- Orthonormal basis
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

# Testing things

Code snippet:
{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
    print(f"Hi, {name}")
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

$$E=mc^2$$
