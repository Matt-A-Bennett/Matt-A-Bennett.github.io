# Building a Python 3 numpy-like module from scratch

I will try to build a library that allows me to do linear algebra operations
(basically like numpy). I will attempt to implement all the steps covered in
Gilbert Strang's Introduction to linear algebra. I will only use python's built
in objects and methods.

## Methods
### Fundamental (done)
- Addition/Subtraction
- Multiplication 
- u' * u = dot product
- u * u' = n by n matrix

### Advanced
- EA = U
- A = LU
- A = QR
- Rank
- Pivot Columns
- Inverse
- Four fundamental subspaces
- Bases for fundamental subspaces
- Determinant
- Projection
- Orthogonalisation
- Orthonormal basis

### Visualisation
- Projection
- Transformation

# Testing things

Code snippet:
{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
    print(f"Hi, {name}")
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

$$E=mc^2$$
