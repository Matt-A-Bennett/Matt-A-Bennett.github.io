<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>If all the pivots of a matrix are strictly greater than zero, then the
matrix is positive definite. If they are greater than or equal to zero, then
the matrix is positive semi-definite. Similary, strictly less than zero means
the matrix is negative definite and if there are also some zeros then the
matrix is negative semi-definite.</p>
