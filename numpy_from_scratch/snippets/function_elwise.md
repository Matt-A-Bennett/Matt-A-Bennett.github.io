<p>We define a useful method for applying any function to each element of a
matrix (e.g. scaling, raising to any power) and for applying any function to
the elements in two matrices to produce a third matrix (e.g. adding, Hadamard
products). The 'function_elwise' method forms the basis for several
operations.</p>
