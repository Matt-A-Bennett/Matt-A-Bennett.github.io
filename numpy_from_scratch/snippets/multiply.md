<p>At a low level, matrix multiplication can be seen as a series of dot
products between the rows of one matrix and the columns of another. For
example, the (2,3) entry of a matrix $C$ produced through the multiplication of
two other matrices $A$ and $B$, would be the dot product of the 2nd row of $A$
with the 3rd row of $B$</p>
