### [Building Numpy from scratch](./numpy_from_scratch/numpy_from_scratch.md)
I write a python package that can do linear algebra operations using python's
standard library.

### [Adding a statistics sub-package](./stats_from_scratch/stats_from_scratch.md)
I use methods in the linear algebra package to implement some basic
statistical modelling concepts.

### [Creating a searchable database using web-scraping in Python 3](./ufc_database/ufc_database.md)
This automates something I found myself repeating: looking up which pairs of
athletes competed in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).

---

### [Configuring FZF to search useful directories beyond the working directory](./fzf_search_dirs/fzf_search_dirs.md)
I customise the way [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) works on my machine
so I can find pretty much any file on my system using a fuzzy search.

---

### [Using FZF to select files for any program or command](./fzf_launcher/fzf_launcher.md)
I write a bash function to act as a wrapper to
[Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) that allows a fuzzy search to locate
files as arguments to any command.

### [Switch between light and dark mode in Vim and Tmux with one command ](./colour_switching_terminal/colour_switching_terminal.md)
My workflow relies on Vim and Tmux. Here I add a command that causes
synchronised colorsheme changes between them.
