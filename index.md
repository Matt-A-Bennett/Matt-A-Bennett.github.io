## About me
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>I earned my PhD in cognitive neuroscience at the University of Glasgow and I
currently work as a postdoc at UCLouvain, Belgium. I work with fmri data and
neural networks. I mainly use python, matlab and R programming languages. I
favour linux machines, and working in the terminal with Vim as my editor of
choice.</p>

## About this site
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>This is a place where I keep a public record of the projects I do in my
spare time. The projects are focused on coding in Python 3 and Bash. The
reason for doing a given project falls into two categories: Either I'm trying
to learn more about some area of coding, or I am sharing something that I made
and find useful to have on my pc.</p>
